# Classroom RPG Battle Simulator

## Characters
- Debugger Dana: A meticulous debugger who deals consistent moderate damage.
- QuizMaster Quincy: A quick thinker who deals variable damage with a wider range.

## OOP Principles Applied
- **Encapsulation:** Character properties like Health and Name are encapsulated with private setters.
- **Inheritance:** Character classes inherit from the abstract base class CharacterBase.
- **Polymorphism:** Attack method is overridden in each character class with unique logic.
- **Abstraction:** CharacterBase defines an abstract Attack method to enforce implementation.
- **Exception Handling:** Input validation and unexpected errors are handled with try-catch blocks and user-friendly messages.

## Challenges Faced
- Designing a simple yet extensible battle system.
- Implementing Windows Forms UI programmatically.
- Ensuring clear separation of concerns and OOP principles.

## How to Run
- Open the RPGGame folder in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the project.
